# CoffeeShop
This is my first project on front end web development. This coffeeshop project developed using HTML, CSS and Jotform. In this project, people can order various coffees from this website and the orders can be seen on Jotform submissions tab. Through this site we can deliver the coffee to the address that filled by the customer through the form.
